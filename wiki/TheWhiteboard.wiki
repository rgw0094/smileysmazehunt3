=== Programming To Do ===
 * Make hoppers use A-star to determine distance from smiley so that they don't try to hop through walls to get to him because it looks like the dickens.
 * Make it so turrets can't kill enemies
 * Make some sort of graphical effect for enemies spawning from the enemy spawners.
 * Barvinoid
 * Fenwar
 * Make enemy blocks not go away until you get the loot
 * Double digit upgrades don't fit in the inventory
 * Draw pits based on current area
 * Completion percentage

=== Sounds To Add ===
 * Walking bombs explosion
 * Calypso boss
 * Mushroom boss
 * Evil wall rumbling
 * Hopping enemies should make a sound when they hop
 * Collecting health/mana items
 * Explosion manager explosions

=== Graphics To Do ===
 * A background for the key display in the lower left corner of the screen because you can't read the numbers over certain terrain.
 * Fenwar orbs (I think they should be an animation)
 * Slime
 * More projectile graphics (snowmen throw snowballs, squirrels throw nuts ETCETERA)

=== Bugs ===
 * There are randomly item particles in places where there shouldn't be
 * Right-Left Spikey enemies sometimes will spawn and move downwards super fast until they hit a wall and the start moving right-left.
 * Gem #'s are huge at start
 * Portly's ice spawning on Smiley freezes you forever.
 * The enemy death sound is played randomly when no enemy is being killed (this is because turrets are killing enemies)
