=== Programming To Do ===
 * Graphical effect for enemies spawning from the enemy spawners. (similar to bartlets)
 * The rest of the monocle man advice topics
 * Fenwar spiders
 * Make it so projectiles from bosses can't be reflected (except Mushboom) or silly padded (except Phyrebawz2)

=== Sounds To Add ===
 * Walking bombs explosion
 * Calypso boss
 * Mushroom boss
 * Barli
 * Fenwar
 * Evil wall rumbling
 * Explosion manager explosions

=== Graphics To Do ===
 * Fenwar near death animation
 * Keys background (in lower corner of screen)
 * Slime
 * More projectile graphics (snowmen throw snowballs, squirrels throw nuts ETCETERA)

=== Bugs ===
 * Right-Left Spikey enemies sometimes will spawn and move downwards super fast until they hit a wall and the start moving right-left.
 * Gem #'s are huge at start
 * Portly's ice spawning on Smiley freezes you forever.
 * When you get Shrink (after beating Magnitogorsk), the text doesn't display.
 * 3 minimap glitches: fake walls aren't dark brown on minimap; deep water doesn't appear when wearing sandals; no collision appears when hopping on a spring
 * 119,156 at Tut: I got a timed switch to stay switched on the wrong side. I was hitting both of the switches in that area repeatedly and quickly when it happened.
