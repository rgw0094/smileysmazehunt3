=== Shit List ===
 * Patric
 * Kevin
 * Hillary

=== Programming To Do ===
 * When enemy graphics overlap draw them so that the lower enemy on the screen is on top
 * Finish Phyrebozz 2
 * Lovecraftian Boss
 * King Tut
 * Bartli
 * Calypso 2
 * Parallax pits - Use ID layer to change HUE to match the level
 * Tentacles are too easy right now.  Change their movement pattern?
 * Have Fenwar make more appearances than just in Smolder Hollow and the end
 * Make the fountain heal you
 * Make not just switches but moving cylinders/mirrors/arrows make a noise.  That way if a far off switch is activating them they don't move silently.  We still need to have the sounds be dependent on how far Smiley is from them though since otherwise levels would just be constant switch-activation noises due to the turrets.

=== Bugs To Consider ===
 * Bouncing spikey enemies that I put to appear in line with each other in game sometimes are not in line when testing, making it a lot harder to get by them than planned.
 * You can still walk diagonally between two arrow blocks.
 * When using fire on the shore of deep water, if you immediately (through the inventory) put on Jesus' Sandals and walk on the water the flame breath will continue to be used long enough to hit ice blocks that should be out of reach.

=== Graphics To Do ===
 * Mirror switch graphic 	 
 * Arrow switch graphic (bunny) 	 
 * Shrink tunnel switch graphic
