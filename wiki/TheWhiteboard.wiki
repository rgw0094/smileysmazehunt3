=== Shit List ===
 * Patric
 * Kevin
 * Hillary
 * Sarah Palin

=== Road Map ===
 * Opening Cinematic
 * World Map
 * Balance stuff

=== Data To Do ===
 * Bill Clinton hints
 * Enemy names
 * Sound effects
 * Fenwar Encounters

=== Programming To Do ===
 * Save files as bits
 * Make it so you can't walk diagonally between two arrow blocks. (expand gay fix in Player.move - right now its only for entering ice and springs)
 * Lovecraftian Boss
 * King Tut
 * Bartli
 * Calypso 2
 * Make not just switches but moving cylinders/mirrors/arrows make a noise.  That way if a far off switch is activating them they don't move silently.  We still need to have the sounds be dependent on how far Smiley is from them though since otherwise levels would just be constant switch-activation noises due to the turrets.

=== Bugs To Consider ===
 * When increasing the music volume from 0 the music won't play until you go to a new zone (this is an HGE bug)
 * Sometimes after talking to an NPC they will walk away facing the wrong direction.
 * Bouncing spikey enemies that I put to appear in line with each other in game sometimes are not in line when testing, making it a lot harder to get by them than planned.
 * When using fire on the shore of deep water, if you immediately (through the inventory) put on Jesus' Sandals and walk on the water the flame breath will continue to be used long enough to hit ice blocks that should be out of reach.

=== Graphics To Do ===
 * Mirror switch graphic 	 
 * Arrow switch graphic (bunny)
