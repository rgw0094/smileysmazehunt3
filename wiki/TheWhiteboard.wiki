=== Programming To Do ===
 * Make particle attacks continue to update while the textbox is active.
 * Leet Death Effect
 * Lovecraftian Boss
 * Barvinoid
 * Fenwar
 * Closing Cinematic

=== Graphics To Do ===
 * Lovecraftian Boss tentacles
 * Pit graphics for different areas
 * More projectile graphics

=== Bugs ===
 * Bouncing spikey enemies that I put to appear in line with each other in game sometimes are not in line when testing, making it a lot harder to get by them than planned. (this is impossible to fix)
 * One time, the "Continue" "Back" and "Delete" buttons in the select file screen went too far down, as if the dt was excessively large the frame before they stopped.
 * Spikey enemies start in the wrong spot sometimes. Ex: the mass of spikey enemies in Egypt, sometimes one of them will move down first and then will bounce horizontally in the wrong spot.

=== Terry's comments ===
 * Put a fence around the barns so you know you can't go in them.
 * When deleting a file, you don't notice the YES/NO easily enough.
