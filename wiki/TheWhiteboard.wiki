=== Programming To Do ===
 * The end credits have a bunch of things to fix: the Gayass Ghost, sentinels, and gumdrops are not in the game (but we could add the gumdrops?), Mr. Bigglesworth is actually called a Walkin'-Bomb, buzzard has no wings, most of the enemies are looking left but would look better looking forward, Barvinoid is missing, Bartli/BrianFungus/Magnitogorsk are missing parts of their bodies.
 * Add the thud noises when you lick a boss.
 * Add new noises to the Fenwar battle and change boss music
 * During the close-up gross licking of Fenwar when he dies, it plays the title theme but I think silence would make the moment more effective.
 * Some of the gem totals in the map are incorrect (SEE LOOT SUMMARY)
 * Implement the goblin using a balloon instead of a clown head.
 * After picking up 1 mana pickup, your mana begins recharging instantly.  This is bad since then there is little incentive to ever pick up more than one since your mana will recharge anyways, and ends up giving you way too much mana.  Then running around owning everyone with orbs is too easy to do.
 * Ice hop should center Smiley on tile
 * After the boss fights are over, the bosses still damage you.  Also other external objects (flames in Phyrebawz2, projectiles in Barvinoid) will still exist and hurt you.
 * Add a little BLURB to the controls window to discretely let the user know they can use gamepads
 * Bartli gets blocked by silly pads. Make it so she runs them over and makes them disappear

=== Sounds To Add ===
 * King Tut shooting lightning (laser_zap)
 * King Tut firing beams of light
 * Barvinoid hovering FOUND
 * Barvinoid landing (DD) FOUND
 * Barvinoid opening/closing mouth FOUND
 * Barvinoid releasing enemies from mouth FOUND
 * Barvinoid shooting from his eye FOUND


=== Graphics To Do ===

 * Cane icon for the inventory
 * Fire floater graphic (in smolder hollow)
 * Gems

=== Bugs ===
 * 119,156 at Tut: I got a timed switch to stay switched on the wrong side. I was hitting both of the switches in that area repeatedly and quickly when it happened. Update 8/26/09: Cannot reproduce this. Oh well -- if it happens in-game, the player is screwed.
 * Spikey guys can't move across spaces formerly consisting of the flame tiles that you put out with the ice breath (this occurs in the realm of despair)
 * When going from an arrow tile onto an ice tile, Smiley gets stuck until you try to move him.  I put a testing spot for this south of Smiley town.
 * A spider dropping blimp randomly disappeared.  It was on its way down in its oscillations and disappeared on what seemed to be its lowest point if that has any relevance.  Also I was just about to lick it and may have just licked it before it went away.  I couldn't reproduce this after many (30 or so) tries.

=== Achievements to add ===
 * Bare Minimum: Defeat Cornwallis without killing any Cactlets on normal or higher
 * Can't Touch This: Defeat 50 enemies in a row without taking any damage
 * You Only Live Once: Beat the game on normal or higher without dying
 * Victory with an Asterisk: beat the game on easy or very easy difficulty
 * Friend of Smiley: beat the game on normal difficulty
 * Friends with Benefits: beat the game on hard difficulty
 * Smiley Master: beat the game on very hard difficulty

=== Balance Issues ===
 * Tut is a bit too easy.  You can just mass flame breath him and kill him easily in 2 cycles.  I think that after you damage him a set amount (say like 25% or 20% of his total life) that he should close his casket up just to assure that the battle isn't trivial.  Also for Bartli we should do something similar.  I suggest that after she craps out a Bartlet that she immediately moves onto her next phase.
 * Likewise for Barvinoid, after you shoot all of his projectiles at him he just sits there for a while before moving.  Just make him move as soon as the projectiles have all been shot.
 * Fenwar is way too easy.  We should make it so that he can throw bombs on the platform that he's on (to avoid being cheap and just standing next to him inside the orb ring.)  Like the above suggestions he should wake up from his stunned phase after a certain % of his life is taken away, because a fully powered up Smiley can easily win after 2 licking sessions.  Also maybe we could add some more things to dodge.  Some ideas I have:  Make the Fen-Eye's also shoot projectiles.  Make Fenwar shoot out circular nova flame attacks like Phyrebawz that you need to float over.  Crazy but perhaps lame idea: have him use all kinds of various attacks similar to old bosses (Cornwallis's spike spirals which you would now need to reflect, perhaps he could release batlets like Garmbourn, release heatseeking evil missiles like Barvinoid.)
 * The ending of the Pools of the Dead is terrible. There needs to be way fewer enemies, or perhaps make those enemies have significantly less health. It was taking me like 10 hits per enemy to kill them.
 * The REFLECTION SHIELD costs way too much mana.

=== Suggestions from testers ===
 * Monocle man's advice goes away too quickly.  My dad was testing using a game pad so didn't even have the keyboard out, and by the time he got to press N the message was gone.  Could we just change it so that you press "Attack" instead?
 * Phyrebawz 1 is too hard.  I put some life in his battle area, which I think is an alright solution, but thought it was worth mentioning here.
 * Could we implement a continue option that doesn't force you to reload your game from the main menu?  After my dad died on Phyrebawz 40 times it became tiresome for him.
